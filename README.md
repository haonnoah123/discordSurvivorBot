# discordSurvivorBot

After learning Java for 4 months I decided to test my skills by coding a Discord Bot that mimics the TV show survivor. I started with the bot having simple functions, such as giving players idols for correctly guessing a number between 1-100. However, I quickly scaled it up adding features like voting and the ability to play idols.
